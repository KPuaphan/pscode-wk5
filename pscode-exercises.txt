// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

m = (2+2)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

m = int(input("Choose your number: "))
  
if m % 2 == 0:

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

# Exercise 3 A

# let it be known, I looked up pretty much everything from this point on, I needed some refreshers xD

n1 = int(input("Choose your first number: "))
n2 = int(input("Choose your second number: "))
n3 = int(input("Choose your third number: "))
n4 = int(input("Choose your fourth number: "))
n5 = int(input("Choose your last number: ")) 

# B


avg = int(n1+n2+n3+n4+n5)/5
print("The average of the selected numbers is "+str(avg))

# C

numbers = [n1,n2,n3,n4,n5]  # these are the numbers the user inputed



min = numbers[0]
max = numbers[0]

for i in range(len(numbers)):
  if numbers [i] > max:
    max = numbers[i]
  elif numbers [i] < min:
    min = numbers[i]

print("Min: ", min)
print("Max: ", max)
